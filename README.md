it is a project based on classification. using machine learning models to classify what will be the different features to predict what kind of heart problem may occur to the patient is predicted using the machine learning models. we use pandas, matplotlib, seaborn,numpy, and scikit-learn to read the data, and then perform EDA, using scikit-learn we can make the model and used streamlit to deploy the model.it is a project based on classification. using machine learning models to classify what will be the different features to predict what kind of heart problem may occur to the patient is predicted using the machine learning models. we use pandas, matplotlib, seaborn,numpy, and scikit-learn to read the data, and then perform EDA, using scikit-learn we can make the model and used streamlit to deploy the model.
